            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>My Birthdate is on May 9 2000, I was born in Fresno. I like to play baseball whenever I have free time, I usually go paintballing also during
                spring and fall. I live with my mom and step-dad. I have two sisters and one brother. One of my sister’s name is
                Alicia which is 7 and my younger sister Madalyn which is 6 months. My brother’s name is Phillip and he is 3 years old.</p>
                
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <p>My dream vacation would have to be the places on the nickelodeon commercials. They look so fun, honestly I have been wanting to go 
                there since I was a kid. Somewhere I want to visit one Paris and I want to see mimes.</p>
                
                <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                    <p>I want to be able to become really good at designing. I recently started and I thought it was really fun, it just sucks to hear people say
                no i dont like it can you change it and blah blah blah. But overall I really do like it because im very creative and it kind of comes natural</p>
                    <p>Another long term goal I want to achieve is being able to draw very good to. I have been drawing since I was little. I draw whenever I have free time
                it is fun to do when I have spare time. Drawing makes me feel very creative also it helps me relax. What I want to get better at is coloring and shading
                and drawing different genere types.</p>
                <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                    <p>By the end of the week i want to finish designing twenty things. I want to do this because it lets myself know what I am capable of and I
                    want to see my creativity in the designing.</p>
                    <p>Another short term goal is to have a 4.0 by th end of the quarter and the rest of the year. This is also something that lets
                    me know what i am capable of.</p>
